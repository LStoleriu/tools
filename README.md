##Install.sh
Installer for [Golang](http://golang.org) compiler and [LiteIde](https://github.com/visualfc/liteide).

###Features
* Check and get last versions of Go compiler and LiteIde and install them.
* Create a more practical layout for LiteIDE (liteide.ini.mini).
* Many gophers use Monaco.ttf font so add Monaco to LiteIde.
* Also create a GOPATH to the go-programs directory and add a HelloWorld project.
* Add launcher to Unity with some useful functions on right-click. Other DE users have a shortcut on desktop. 

###Using
Download anywhere, make it executable and run. If you want to watch the installation process run it in Terminal.

`./Install.sh`

Run periodicaly or if compiler/ide versions change to update the sistem. Projects are not affected if you overinstall.
